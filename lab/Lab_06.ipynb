    "To start off, you will examine how the Poisson distribution arises out of a simple set of assumptions about the process of arrivals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate ###\n",
    "The process has a numerical parameter $\\lambda > 0$ that is the expected number of arrivals per unit time. The arrivals are random, of course, so there will most likely be different numbers of arrivals in successive units of time. You can think of $\\lambda$ as an average over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher $\\lambda$ is, the more arrivals you expect per unit time. So $\\lambda$ is called the *intensity* of the process, or the *arrival rate*, which is usually shortened to just *rate*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code, we will use `lam` for $\\lambda$ because `lambda` has a different meaning in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the rate is a constant, not a function of time. That is, the intensity of arrivals is the same at all times. Under this assumption the process is called *time-homogeneous* or just *homogeneous*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should only use this model in situations where the assumption of homogeneity is reasonable. You would not want to assume time homogeneity in situations where the intensity of arrivals varies over time. For example, If you are modeling people arriving at the ticket counter of a movie theater, you might expect more crowding right before movie start times than at other times.\n",

    "\"All models are wrong. Some are useful.\" This trenchant assessment of modeling is attributed to the British statistician [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box) and has been the subject of [much discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).\n",
    "\n",
    "What Box was saying was that while no statistical model can capture all the complexity of a physical system, sometimes simple representations can help us begin to understand systems without taking all of the complexity into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep that in mind as you skim this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665405/) in a 2016 issue of [The American Statistician](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1200484#.XKWnbutKgyd), a publication of [The American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/). It includes the use of the homogeneous Poisson process to model times of earthquakes in California. It's not surprising that the model might be an over-simplification; see for example this [lecture](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Seminars/psu10.pdf) by Prof. [Philip Stark](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/) of Berkeley's Statistics department. However, it's OK as a rough starting point, and you can use it to make some rough predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the data used in the paper. The table `quakes` consists of data on all earthquakes in California of magnitude 4.9 or greater, between January 1857 and August 2014. There were 51 such quakes. Of course there were smaller earthquakes too, but those are not part of the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In what follows, the word \"quake\" means \"earthquake of magnitude 4.9 or more\".**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Magnitude` is a measure of the strength of an earthquake, and `MMI` stands for the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale that measures the intensity of shaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important attribute for the analysis is the `Gap` in time, measured in days, between the quake and the previous one."
