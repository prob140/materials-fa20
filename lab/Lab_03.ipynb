Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been successfully used to decode messages encrypted using substitution codes and also [more complex](http://probability.ca/jeff/ftpdir/decipherart.pdf) encryption methods. In this lab you will apply MCMC and the Metropolis algorithm to decode English text that has been encrypted with a substitution code.\n",

It was presented at the 25th anniversary celebrations of MSRI up the hill, and appeared in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in November 2008. The code is based on [Simulation and Solving Substitution Codes](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~sbc502/decode.pdf) written by [Stephen Connor](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/stephen-connor/) in 2003.\n",

When the alphabet is large, making an exhaustive list of all possible decoders and scores is not feasible. That's where the Monte Carlo part of the algorithm comes in. The idea is to choose decoders at random using an algorithm that favors good decoders over bad ones.\n",
